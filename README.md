Visualizing Global Migration Flows, 1960-2000
=============================================
How has bilateral migration flows changed from 1960-2000? 

Using bilateral flow estimates for 191 countries between 1960 and 2000 from Abel (2013), the R packages igraph and animation, and some stylistic examples from Gabriel Michael,  I was able to create the above animation of change in migrant flows between selected countries (other country subsets are also available). Edge colors are weighted by color with darker red edges indicating higher flows while lighter yellow indicating lower flows.
