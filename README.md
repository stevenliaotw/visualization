Visualizing Global Migration Flows, 1960-2000
=============================================

![](/data-raw/bilateral-flows-1960-2000.gif)
How has bilateral migration flows changed from 1960-2000? 

I created the above animation using bilateral flow estimates for 191 countries between 1960 and 2000 from [Abel (2013)](http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol28/18/), the R packages [igraph](http://igraph.sourceforge.net/) and [animation](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html), and some stylistic examples from [Gabriel Michael](http://topromotetheprogress.wordpress.com/2013/11/17/visualizing-negotiating-positions-in-the-tpp-ip-chapter/). Edge colors are weighted by color: darker red edges indicate larger flows while lighter yellow indicate smaller flows.
